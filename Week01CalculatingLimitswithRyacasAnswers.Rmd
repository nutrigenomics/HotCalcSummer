```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This basic exercise is meant for you to learn how to use the Ryacas library to calculate basic limits.

```{r}

install.packages("Ryacas")

library(Ryacas)

x <- ysym("x")      # Defining x as a symbolic variable

lim(sin(x)/x, x, 0) # Limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0

```

```{r}

# Use Ryacas to find the limit for the following functions:

#  = x^2, as x -> 3

lim(x**2, x, 3)

# y = 2x, as x -> 10

lim(2*x, x, 10)

# y = 7x + 2, as x -> -5

lim(7*x+2, x, -5)

```
