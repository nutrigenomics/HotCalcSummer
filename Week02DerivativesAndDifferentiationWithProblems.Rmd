```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

# install.packages("mosaic") # For plotFun function
# install.packages("mosaicCalc") # For the calculus stuff
# install.packages("deSolve")

library(mosaic)
library(mosaicCalc)
library(deSolve)

# Just if you need it for help:
#example(D)

```


For the equations: (x^2), (x^2 + 3x + 6), sin(x), (1/x), and ln(x):

```{r}

# 1. Use makeFun to turn the equations into Functions, and then call a vector, titled "vec", within each function in the a(vec) format. This vector - representing the x values 1, 2, 5, 10 - can be used this way to test the function at these values.

# Look around the 3.5 minute mark of the Derivatives in R video to see how the demonstrator uses makeFun to store these functions in an f(x) format.


```

  
```{r}

# 2. Use the D() function to find the derivative formula of the previous equations, using the D(a(x)~x) format.

# Make sure you have read Chapter 5 of Start R in Calculus (Kaplan, http://www.tf.uns.ac.rs/~omorr/radovan_omorjan_003_prII/r-examples/StartR-master.pdf) before you tackle this! The mosiac package (shown in the Kaplan text) no longer holds these functions; use the first block of code in this Rmd file to install the successor, mosaicCalc, via install.packages("mosaicCalc") and load the library via library(mosaicCalc)



```

```{r}

#  3. Store the D() functions written in 1. to a variable, g. Use a g(x) type calling format to find the derivative values at these same x values of 1, 2, 5, 10. Check the Derivatives in R video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1QHNsoch98) and Chapter 5 in Start R in Calculus (http://www.tf.uns.ac.rs/~omorr/radovan_omorjan_003_prII/r-examples/StartR-master.pdf).

# Hint: you can set up a vector (call it "vec") for all the x values, and then call the function like g(vec), h(vec), etc.



```

```{r}
# 4. Plot each of the variables and their derivatives on the same graph, using a green line for the derivatives.

# Hint: to get started on plotting these functions, double check the end of the Derivatives in R video assigned for this week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1QHNsoch98



```


```{r}

#  5. Plot the functions on one shared graph, in different colors



```

```{r}

# 6. Plot the SIR model using the integrateODE() functions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2IQ0_I3mQ), as shown
